# The Problem

The R programming language has become increasingly popular in data science, statistical computing, and bioinformatics. However, it lacks native support for orchestrating and managing containerized applications in Kubernetes environments. This gap presents several challenges:

1. **Limited accessibility**: R users, particularly in academic and research settings, often struggle to leverage the power of Kubernetes for scaling their computational workflows.

2. **Dependency on external tools**: Current solutions require R users to rely on external CLI tools or wrappers, introducing complexity and potential compatibility issues.

3. **Inefficient workflow integration**: The absence of a native R client for Kubernetes hinders seamless integration of containerized applications within R-based data analysis pipelines.

4. **Underutilization of cloud resources**: Many R users are unable to fully exploit cloud-based Kubernetes clusters for distributed computing, limiting the scale and efficiency of their analyses.

5. **Steep learning curve**: R users must learn additional technologies and paradigms to work with Kubernetes, creating a barrier to adoption.

Previous attempts to address this problem have been limited in scope, often relying on system calls to kubectl or providing narrow functionalities. These solutions fail to offer a comprehensive, R-native approach to Kubernetes interaction.

Tackling this problem is crucial for several reasons:

- It will empower R users to harness the full potential of container orchestration and cloud computing.
- It will bridge the gap between statistical computing and modern DevOps practices.
- It will enable more efficient and scalable computational workflows in fields such as bioinformatics, where R is widely used.
- It will foster greater collaboration between data scientists and infrastructure teams.


# The proposal

## Overview

We propose the development of a comprehensive, native R client library for Kubernetes. This library will provide a seamless interface between R and Kubernetes, allowing users to interact with Kubernetes clusters directly from their R environment. Key features of our proposal include:

1. A dynamic API wrapper that adapts to any active Kubernetes cluster, including support for Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).
2. Bespoke services for core Kubernetes resources, offering an intuitive and R-idiomatic way to manage common objects like Pods, Services, and Deployments.
3. Comprehensive documentation and tutorials to facilitate adoption by the R community.

This project is endorsed by Bioconductor, with Core team members committed to providing feedback and guidance throughout the development process. This endorsement ensures that the library will be developed in alignment with Bioconductor's high standards and will seamlessly integrate with the broader Bioconductor ecosystem in the future.

This project will significantly benefit the R community by:

- Enabling R users to easily deploy and manage containerized applications and workflows.
- Providing a native, dependency-free solution for Kubernetes interaction.
- Facilitating the use of cloud resources for computationally intensive tasks in R.
- Streamlining the development of scalable, reproducible research environments.
- Fostering collaboration between R developers and DevOps teams.

## Detail

Our proposed R-based Kubernetes client library will be built on the following architecture:

1. **Core API Wrapper**: A dynamic, generated set of R functions that map directly to the Kubernetes API endpoints. This component will use the `rapiclient` package to interact with the Kubernetes API server.

2. **Resource-Specific Functions**: A layer of R functions providing intuitive, high-level interactions with common Kubernetes resources (e.g., Namespaces, Pods, Deployments).

3. **Authentication and Configuration**: Utilities for managing Kubernetes authentication and cluster configuration within R sessions.

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will include:

- Complete API wrapper generation for core Kubernetes resources
- CRUD operations for fundamental resources (Namespaces, Pods, Services, Deployments)
- Basic cluster authentication and configuration management
- Comprehensive documentation and usage examples

Assumptions:

- Users have basic familiarity with Kubernetes concepts
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (local or remote) for development and testing
- R 4.0+ as the target environment

# Requirements

## People

The project will require:

1. One lead R developer with experience in both R package development and Kubernetes
2. Advisory input from Kubernetes experts and the Bioconductor Core team

## Processes

We will implement the following processes:

1. Adopt the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
2. Establish bi-weekly check-ins with Bioconductor Core team advisors
3. Conduct monthly progress reviews with the ISC
4. Set up a public GitHub repository for transparent development
5. Implement a thorough code review process, involving Bioconductor Core team members

## Tools & Tech

The project will utilize:

1. R (version 4.0+) and relevant CRAN packages (e.g., rapiclient, httr)
2. Git for version control
3. GitHub for project management and collaboration
4. Docker for creating test environments
5. A Kubernetes cluster for development and testing (e.g., minikube, kind, or a cloud-based solution)
6. CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment

## Funding

We request funding for personnel costs for one developer (18 months)

Total requested funding: $80,000

This project will also receive material support from the Bioconductor Project, in the form of access to the NSF Jetstream2 allocation, where a Kubernetes cluster will be used for development and testing, and guidance from the Bioconductor Core team.

## Summary

The requested funding will support a dedicated developer to create, test, and document a native R client for Kubernetes over 18 months. This investment, coupled with the endorsement and guidance from the Bioconductor Core team, will result in a powerful tool that bridges the gap between R and modern container orchestration, benefiting a wide range of R users in academia, research, and industry.

# Success

## Definition of done

The project will be considered complete when:

1. The R package is available on CRAN, with Bioconductor Core team having reviewed and approved the package
2. The library supports interaction with all core Kubernetes resources, and dynamic wrappers for API extensions
3. Full documentation and tutorials are published
4. At least one real-world example of the library's use is published
5. The library is listed as a community-maintained R library on the official list of Kubernetes client libraries: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/

## Measuring success

We will track the following metrics:

1. Number of GitHub stars and forks
2. Number of CRAN downloads
3. Community contributions, engagement, and issue resolution rate
4. Adoption in academic papers and/or industry projects

## Future work

Potential extensions include:

1. Integration with BiocParallel for distributed computing on Kubernetes clusters (with funding potentially available via Bioconductor NIH grant)
2. Integration with other R parallelization frameworks
3. Development of high-level workflow templates for common bioinformatics tasks

## Key risks

Rapid changes in Kubernetes API versions and core resources, requiring a dynamic design, avoiding hardcoded API versions.

# Project plan
