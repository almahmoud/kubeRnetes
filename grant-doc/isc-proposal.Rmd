# 1. The Problem

The R programming language has become a cornerstone in data science, statistical computing, and bioinformatics. However, it currently lacks native support for orchestrating and managing containerized applications in Kubernetes environments. This gap presents several significant challenges:

1.1. **Limited accessibility**: R users, particularly in academic and research settings, struggle to leverage the power of Kubernetes for scaling their computational workflows. This limitation hinders the potential for large-scale data analysis and high-performance computing in R-based research projects.

1.2. **Dependency on external tools**: Current solutions require R users to rely on external command-line interface (CLI) tools. This dependency introduces complexity and potential compatibility issues, significantly impacting both reproducibility (crucial for scientific users) and portability (essential for industry and general users).

1.3. **Steep learning curve and resource underutilization**: The absence of a native R client for Kubernetes creates a substantial barrier to adoption. R users must learn additional technologies and paradigms to work with Kubernetes, which hinders the seamless integration of containerized applications within R-based data analysis pipelines. Consequently, many R users are unable to fully leverage cloud-based Kubernetes clusters for distributed computing, limiting the scale and efficiency of their analyses.

Previous attempts to address this problem have been limited in scope, often relying on CLI tools and providing narrow functionalities for specific cloud providers. These have gone unmaintained for several years and failed to offer a comprehensive, R-native approach to Kubernetes interaction. Notably, no R package could be found on CRAN or GitHub allowing users to universally interact with a Kubernetes cluster.

Addressing this problem is crucial for several reasons:

a) It will empower R users to harness the full potential of container orchestration and cloud computing, enabling more efficient and scalable computational workflows. This will allow researchers and data scientists to tackle larger and more complex problems in R.
b) It will enhance R's capabilities in fields requiring high-performance computing, such as bioinformatics, by enabling R users to process and analyze large-scale datasets more effectively, keeping pace with the growing data demands in many fields.
c) It will democratize access to advanced computing resources, allowing smaller research groups and individual data scientists to leverage enterprise-grade infrastructure without the need for extensive DevOps expertise.
d) It will bridge the gap between statistical computing and modern DevOps practices, fostering greater collaboration between data scientists and infrastructure teams. This integration will lead to more robust, scalable, and maintainable data science pipelines.


# 2. The Proposal

## 2.1 Overview

We propose the development of a comprehensive, native R client library for Kubernetes. This library will provide a seamless interface between R and Kubernetes, allowing users to interact with Kubernetes clusters directly from their R environment. The key features of our proposal include:

1. A dynamic API wrapper that adapts to any active Kubernetes cluster, including support for Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). This flexibility ensures that the library can work with various Kubernetes distributions and custom extensions.

2. Bespoke services for core Kubernetes resources, offering an intuitive and R-idiomatic way to manage common objects such as Pods, Namespaces, Services, Deployments, etc. These high-level functions will simplify common tasks for R users unfamiliar with Kubernetes internals and detailed object structures.

3. Comprehensive documentation and tutorials to facilitate adoption by the R community, including examples of real-world use cases in scientific computing and data analysis.

This project has received endorsement from Bioconductor, with Core team members willing to provide feedback and guidance in the development process. Bioconductor's involvement ensures that the library will be developed in alignment with Bioconductor's high standards and will seamlessly integrate with the broader Bioconductor ecosystem in the future.

The proposed R Kubernetes client library will significantly benefit the R community by:

- Improving reproducibility and portability of R analyses through a native, dependency-free solution for Kubernetes interaction. This will R users to easily deploy and manage containerized applications and workflows, enhancing the scalability of R-based projects. This will allow researchers and data scientists to tackle larger and more complex problems efficiently.
- Facilitating "in-place" computing for big data analysis and high-performance computing tasks. Users can launch containers directly within cloud environments where their datasets reside, avoiding egress fees associated with transferring large volumes of data out of storage. This approach significantly reduces costs and improves performance for data-intensive computations.
- Fostering collaboration between R developers and DevOps teams by bridging the gap between statistical computing and modern infrastructure management. This integration will lead to more robust, scalable, and maintainable data science pipelines in both academic and industry settings.
- Democratizing access to advanced computing resources, allowing smaller research groups and individual data scientists to leverage enterprise-grade infrastructure without extensive DevOps expertise. This will level the playing field in computational research across various disciplines.


## 2.2 Detailed Architecture

Our proposed R-based Kubernetes client library will be built on the following architecture:

1. **Dynamic API Wrapper**: 
   - A dynamically generated set of R functions that map directly to the existing Kubernetes API endpoints. 
   - This component will utilize the `rapiclient` package to interact with the Kubernetes API server. 
   - The dynamic wrapper will provide expert users full access to all API functions, wrapping the server's schema (including API extensions added to the cluster via Custom Resource Definitions).
   - This approach ensures flexibility and future-proofing against Kubernetes API changes.

2. **Resource-Specific Functions**: 
   - A layer of R functions providing intuitive, high-level interactions with common Kubernetes resources. 
   - These functions will be implemented for resources in the core Kubernetes API schema, enabling general users easy access to basic CRUD operations on core resources.
   - Examples include: `create_namespace(name="my-ns")`, `delete_job(name='my-job', namespace='my-ns')`, `apply_pod(name='my-job', namespace='my-ns', spec=newjobspec)`.
   - This abstraction layer will significantly lower the barrier to entry for R users new to Kubernetes.

3. **Authentication and Configuration**: 
   - Utilities for managing Kubernetes authentication and cluster configuration within R sessions. 
   - Initial implementation will focus on basic kubeconfig authentication.
   - Multi-cluster management capabilities and other features will be later added.

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will include:

- Complete API wrapper generation for the Kubernetes server
- CRUD operations for Core resources (Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets, PersistentVolumes, PersistentVolumeClaims, Namespaces, Roles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings, ServiceAccounts)
- Basic cluster authentication and configuration management (Events and KubeConfig)
- Comprehensive documentation and usage examples
- Integration tests ensuring compatibility with major Kubernetes distributions
